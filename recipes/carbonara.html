    <h3>Carbonara is a pasta dish made with eggs, hard cheese, fatty cured pork, and black pepper. The cheese is usually pecorino romano. Spaghetti is the most common pasta. while guanciale, a cured pork jowl, is traditional, some variations use pancetta.</h3>
    <h3>Carbonara in Italian means charcoal burner. It is said that this dish got it's name because it was a favorite for these hard workers who needed something tasteful and filling after a day in the mines.</h3>
